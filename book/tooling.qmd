# Tooling

*Package tooling i.e. debugging plots, ks-test etc.*

Now that I have implemented most of the base features, I will be able to add a
bunch of QOL and tooling. 

Right now, I have made a visual debugger for the model fitting:

Try setting `debug = T` when fitting a model.

```{r}
# Include debugger plot here
```

What other info do you think it should display?

Also have KS testing / Network statistics plotting in the works.

```{r}

```
