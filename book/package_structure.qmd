# Package Structure

Same structure as the original repo, however you now provide the events
data directly, rather than converting it to a network beforehand.

See following: 

![Current package pipeline, subject to changes.](data_pipeline.png){width=400px}

So plug data into `make_events()`, choose a kernel and you're good.

Now, you could argue that the `make_events()` shouldn't be exposed to
the user, and that it should happen internally. IDK I kind of like
seeing how the events are structured.

Also how do we feel in general about providing data as data frames
rather than networks? To me it feels much more natural, and it is much
easier to work with the original data frames than trying to make changes
using the network functions.

Also I believe in the legacy code, edge less node arrivals were not
supported in the `events_to_net()` function, as it only took edges as an
argument.
