# Package Structure

Same structure as the original repo, however you now provide the events data
directly, rather than converting it to a network beforehand.

See:

So plug data into `make_events()`, choose a kernel and you're good. 

Now, you could argue that the `make_events()` shouldn't be exposed to the user,
and that it should happen internally. IDK I kind of like seeing how the events
are structured.

Also how do we feel in general about providing data as data frames rather than 
networks? To me it feels much more natural, and it is much easier to work with
the original data frames than trying to make changes using the network functions.

Also I believe in the legacy code, edge less node arrivals were not supported in 
the `events_to_net()` function, as it only took edges as an argument.
