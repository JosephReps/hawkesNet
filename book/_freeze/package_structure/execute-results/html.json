IDK I kind of like\nseeing how the events are structured.\n\nAlso how do we feel in general about providing data as data frames\nrather than networks? To me it feels much more natural, and it is much\neasier to work with the original data frames than trying to make changes\nusing the network functions.\n\nAlso I believe in the legacy code, edge less node arrivals were not\nsupported in the `events_to_net()` function, as it only took edges as an\nargument.\n",
