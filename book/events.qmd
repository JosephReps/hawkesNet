# Events

So as stated, shifted from providing a network, to providing raw event data.
Opinions?

Example:

```{r}
nodes <- data.frame(
  id   = c("1", "2", "3"),
  time = c(0, 1, 2)
)
edges <- data.frame(
  i    = c("1", "1"),
  j    = c("2", "3"),
  time = c(1, 2)
)

ev <- make_events(nodes = nodes, edges = edges)
ev
```

In the case you only have `edges`, the `make_events()` function will implicitly
generate the nodes as they appear in `edges`. Note this is assuming that nodes
join the network at the first time in which they appear in `edges`.

```{r}
edges <- data.frame(
  i    = c("1", "1"),
  j    = c("2", "3"),
  time = c(1, 2)
)

fixNet::make_events(edges = edges)
```

There are also two useful helpers for working with events, `edges_by_event()` and
`nodes_by_event()`:

```{r}
edges_by_event(ev)
nodes_by_event(ev)
```
