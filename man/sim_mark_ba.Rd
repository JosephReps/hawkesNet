\title{Simulate BA mark (arrivals + edges) for one event}
\usage{
sim_mark_ba(state, t_k, params, delta = 0.001, new_node = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{state}{Pre-event state (must include named deg, born).}

\item{t_k}{Numeric scalar event time.}

\item{params}{List containing at least beta_edges and delta.}

\item{new_node}{Optional character scalar to force the arriving node id
(useful for tests). If NULL, generated from state.}
}
\value{
list(arrivals = <chr>, edges = data.frame(i,j))
}
\description{
Paper BA: exactly one arriving node at each accepted event time.
Given pre-event state, connect the new node to each old node v
independently with probability p_v from edge_probs_ba().
