\title{Simulate BA-bip mark (arrivals + edges) for one event}
\usage{
sim_mark_ba_bip(net, t_k, params, delta = 0.001, new_event_id = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{net}{Pre-event network state.}

\item{t_k}{Numeric scalar event time.}

\item{params}{List containing at least beta_edges and lambda_new.}

\item{delta}{Nonnegative scalar baseline for attractiveness.}

\item{new_event_id}{Optional character scalar to force the event node id (tests).}
}
\value{
list(arrivals = <data.frame(id, role)>, edges = <data.frame(i,j)>)
}
\description{
Strict BA-bip generative story:
- Exactly 1 new EVENT node arrives at each accepted event time.
- Additionally, K new PERP nodes arrive, with K ~ Poisson(lambda_new).
- Deterministic edges: new_event -- each new_perp.
- Bernoulli edges: new_event -- each OLD perp i independently with probability p_i,
  where p_i is proportional to (deg_i + delta) * exp(-beta_edges * age_i),
  normalized over OLD perp nodes only.
}
\details{
This is the network-based version (net stores vertex attrs `time` and `role`).
The return format matches sim_mark_ba(): `arrivals` is a data.frame of new nodes,
and `edges` is a data.frame of new edges.
