\title{Log PMF of the BA mark kernel for one event}
\usage{
log_pmf_ba(net, new_nodes, new_edges, t_k, params, delta = 0.001)
}
\arguments{
\item{net}{network object, the current network at time t_k}

\item{new_nodes}{data.frame with at least column "id". Any additional
columns will be treated as vertex attributes.}

\item{new_edges}{data.frame with at least columns "i" and "j". Any additional
columns will be treated as edge attributes.}

\item{t_k}{numeric scalar, the event timestamp}

\item{params}{Named list of model parameters. Must contain `beta_edges`.}

\item{delta}{Nonnegative scalar added for numerical stability in attachment
probabilities (passed to `edge_probs_ba()`).}
}
\value{
A list with:
\describe{
  \item{edge_probs}{Named numeric vector of attachment probabilities for each
  eligible existing (old) node.}
  \item{logp}{Scalar log probability of the observed edges for this event.}
}
}
\description{
Computes the log probability of the observed new–old edge set (`new_edges`)
under the Barabási–Albert (BA) Bernoulli-product mark model at event time
`t_k`. Returns both the per-old-node attachment probabilities and the log PMF.
}
\details{
The BA mark model assumes exactly one arriving node in `new_nodes`. Edges in
`new_edges` are treated as new–old attachments; if there are no existing nodes
in `net`, the only valid observation is `new_edges` empty.
