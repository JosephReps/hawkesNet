edges_by_event(events)
}
\arguments{

A list with one element per event. Element `[[k]]` is a data.frame of
  edges for event `k` with columns `i` and `j` (plus any additional edge
  attributes), excluding `event_id`. Events with zero edges return a 0-row
  data.frame with the same columns.

Edge endpoints `i` and `j` are coerced to character, and rows with missing or
empty endpoints are dropped.
