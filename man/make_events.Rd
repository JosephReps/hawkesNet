\title{Create a marked network-growth event stream}
\usage{
make_events(
  nodes = NULL,
  edges,
  allow_implicit_birth = TRUE,
  allow_multi_edges = FALSE,
  state0 = state_init()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{nodes}{Optional data.frame with columns `id`, `time`.
Additional columns are allowed and will be preserved.}

\item{edges}{data.frame with columns `i`, `j`, `time`.
Additional columns are allowed and will be preserved.
(May be empty but must be provided.)}

\item{allow_implicit_birth}{Logical; if TRUE (default), endpoints missing from `nodes`
and missing from `state0` are treated as born at their first incident edge time.}

\item{allow_multi_edges}{Logical; if FALSE (default), an undirected edge may be added at most once.}

\item{state0}{Optional initial state (e.g., from `make_state()`), used only to
define baseline nodes and their birth times for validation. Must be a state
list with at least `born` (named numeric) or `deg` (named integer).}
}
\value{
An object of class `hg_events` with data.frames `times`, `nodes`, `edges`.
}
\description{
This package models a growing network as a sequence of **event times**.
At each time, two things may happen:
1) Node arrivals (possibly zero)
2) Edge additions (possibly zero)
}
\details{
The event stream is constructed from timestamped `nodes` and `edges`.
Optionally, you may provide an initial baseline network state `state0`
(built by `make_state()`), which defines nodes that already exist at the
observation start. Baseline nodes in `state0` are treated as *known endpoints*
for validation, but they are NOT added as events.

Extra columns in `nodes` and `edges` are preserved and carried through into the
returned `hg_events` object. In the returned object, `time` is replaced by
`event_id` (an integer index into `times`).
