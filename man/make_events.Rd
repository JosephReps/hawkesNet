\title{Create a marked network-growth event stream}
\usage{
make_events(
  edges,
  nodes = NULL,
  allow_implicit_birth = TRUE,
  allow_multi_edges = FALSE,
  initial_network = net_init()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{edges}{data.frame with columns \code{i}, \code{j}, \code{time}. Extra columns allowed.}

\item{nodes}{Optional data.frame with columns \code{id}, \code{time}. Extra columns allowed.}

\item{allow_implicit_birth}{Logical; if TRUE (default), endpoints missing from
\code{nodes} and missing from \code{initial_network} are treated as born at their first
incident edge time.}

\item{allow_multi_edges}{Logical; if FALSE (default), an undirected edge may be added at most once.}

\item{initial_network}{Optional baseline \code{network} object used for validation only.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{events} with data.frames \code{times}, \code{nodes}, \code{edges}.
}
\description{
Construct an event stream from timestamped node arrivals and edge additions.
Baseline nodes can be provided via \code{initial_network} for validation only (they
are not added as events).
}
\details{
Extra columns in \code{nodes} and \code{edges} are preserved and passed to the internal
network object as vertex and edge attributes. The returned object uses
\code{event_id} (index into \code{times}) rather than raw \code{time} columns.
\subsection{Input contract (requirements)}{

The following requirements are enforced via errors (and covered by tests):

\strong{edges}
\itemize{
\item \code{edges} must be provided (may be empty), and be coercible to a data.frame.
\item Must contain columns: \code{i}, \code{j}, \code{time}.
\item \code{i} and \code{j} must be non-missing, non-empty (after coercion to character).
\item No self-loops: \code{i != j}.
\item \code{time} must be finite numeric.
\item If \code{allow_multi_edges = FALSE} (default), each undirected edge \verb{\{i,j\}} may
appear at most once (duplicates after undirected canonicalization error).
}

\strong{nodes}
\itemize{
\item If supplied, \code{nodes} must have columns: \code{id}, \code{time} (extra cols allowed).
\item \code{id} must be non-missing, non-empty (after coercion to character) and unique.
\item \code{time} must be finite numeric.
}

\strong{initial_network}
\itemize{
\item \code{initial_network} must be a \code{network} object (or NULL).
\item Baseline node ids (vertex names) must not also appear in \code{nodes$id}
(one-way input: baseline in \code{initial_network}, arrivals in \code{nodes}).
\item If \code{initial_network} has vertex attribute \code{"born"}, it must be numeric
and finite for all baseline nodes (used for edge-after-birth validation).
If absent, baseline nodes are treated as born at \code{-Inf}.
}

\strong{cross-constraints}
\itemize{
\item If \code{allow_implicit_birth = FALSE}, every edge endpoint must appear in
\code{nodes$id} or \code{initial_network}.
\item Every edge must occur after both endpoints are born (from \code{nodes} times
and baseline \code{"born"} times, or \code{-Inf} if not provided).
}
}
