\title{Construct an initial network state (baseline graph) at observation start T0}
\usage{
make_state(nodes0 = NULL, edges0 = NULL, T0 = 0, implicit_nodes = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{nodes0}{NULL; or a data.frame with column `id` and optional column `time`;
or a vector of node IDs.}

\item{edges0}{NULL; or a data.frame with columns `i`, `j` giving baseline edges.}

\item{T0}{numeric scalar. Observation window start time; also default birth time.}

\item{implicit_nodes}{logical. If TRUE, nodes appearing in edges0 are allowed even
if nodes0 is NULL; if FALSE, every edge endpoint must be listed in nodes0.}
}
\value{
A state object compatible with state_step()/mark kernels.
}
\description{
Baseline state is used by mark kernels (e.g., BA) and does NOT contribute
Hawkes temporal history (which is controlled by the event times).
}
\details{
Birth times are specified in exactly one way:
  - if nodes0 is a data.frame and includes column `time`, those are used
  - otherwise all baseline nodes are assigned birth time T0
}
